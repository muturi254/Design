## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Learnt how to manipulate typography from line height to kernelin and letter spacing. Majorly I learnt how to use flexbox.

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum sit dolor mesit</p>
````

```css
p {
    line-space: 1em;
}
```

### Continued development

Learn how to integrate and combine flex and grid layout for advanced and fluid UI's.



### Useful resources

- [Interneting is hard](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
